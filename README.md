#Highest-revenue-comapnies-in-USA

In this project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of the world's largest companies by revenue, utilizing data from the Wikipedia page. The project involved web scraping the data using BeautifulSoup, followed by extensive data cleaning to handle inconsistencies and missing values. I applied various data visualization techniques to uncover insights into company performance, sector dominance, and geographic distribution. The final visualizations were created using PowerBI, providing clear and meaningful insights into global corporate revenue rankings.
